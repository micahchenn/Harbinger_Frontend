## Module and Code Structure Overview

## Installation

This project uses several dependencies:

- `axios`: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests from both the browser and Node.js.
- `react-router-dom`: A collection of navigational components for managing and implementing routing in a React application.
- `jwt-decode`: A small browser library that helps decoding JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to extract and use the encoded data.
- `dotenv`: A zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into `process.env`. It's used to handle project configuration.

To install these dependencies, run the following command:

```bash
npm install axios react-router-dom jwt-decode dotenv
